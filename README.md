# Transfer-Learning--Resnet50

Distinguish bees from wasps:

Bees are often confused with wasps because they have a similar shape, Both are flying, stinging insects that are part of the same family. Spotting and knowing the difference between the two is important for getting control of these stinging pests. It would be very difficult to distinguish between bees and wasps with human eyes.So deep learning can be used to distinguish bees from wasps, the algorithm can also be used to check whether a image has a bee or not.

A dataset is available in Kaggle website, that has around 11500 images (including training, validation, test images). Also a CSV file is available with labels for each image. This dataset has been used to train and test the model.

Training and Evaluation:

Transfer learning - resnet50 model is used as pretrain model to apply transfer learning, which gave better result with less number of epochs.

Code along with the details is given in the notebook attached in this repository.
